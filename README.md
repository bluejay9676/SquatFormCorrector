# SquatFormCorrector

What do you do if you don't have any friends to look over your ugly ass squat form?

## Set up
1. Follow the instruction on https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-macos/ to set up opencv and necessary libs.

2. RUN getModels.sh from command line.

## How to run
python3 corrector.py {input_name} {output_name} {mode} {write_result_to_avi} {side_view} {delay_rate} {draw_skeleton}

Passing in 0 for {input_name} will use the webcam on your computer and do realtime analysis of your squat form.
